  "about_body_1": "This year has been like no other. As we remained indoors and physically distanced ourselves from the world this year, did you realise we are surrounded by people who are constantly helping us, contributing silently to our needs. It could be your cook, your neighbour, your vegetable vendor, your family, your lover, friends who video chat from miles away, sanitation workers who keep your area clean, your doctor, the medical shop owner, food delivery person — or even your pet! Here's a chance to recognise them, appreciate their efforts during this time and share the stories of these real-life heroes.",
  "about_body_2": "As we come towards the end of 2020 - the year that the entire world will remember for witnessing the fragility of human life irrespective of gender, colour, class, religious and political beliefs, we present #My2020Hero - an initiative for you to share a photo and story about ‘your real-life hero’ this year! You can send it to us in your local language as well! Check the rules for submission before you submit. The best entries will be selected by a jury and featured in an online exhibition that will acknowledge the efforts of many unsung heroes from all across India!",
